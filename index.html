    <p>My name is Adebayo Waris. I am based in Nigeria. I decided to join Altshool 
        because it offer an immersive and focused learning experience,
         allowing me to quickly gain practical skills in a short amount of time.</p>
    <p>My goal is to secure a position in a prominent technology company or thrive as a successful freelancer in the field of frontend development. 
        I am excited about the opportunity to learn and contribute to the field of technology.</p>
